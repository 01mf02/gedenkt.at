title: Running Turing machines in Haskell, pt. 2
---

Some days ago, I was challenged to make a smaller version of my
[Turing machine simulator in Haskell](/blog/2015-01-10-turinghaskell.html),
which I did:

~~~ haskell
hdTl [] = (Nothing, [])
hdTl (x:xs) = (Just x, xs)

trans f (s, (l, c, r)) =
  either (\ s' -> let (h, t) = hdTl l in (s', (t, h, c':r)))
         (\ s' -> let (h, t) = hdTl r in (s', (c':l, h, t))) m
  where (c', m) = f c s

run f s = takeWhile ((`notElem` s) . fst) . iterate (trans f)
~~~

This version is a bit more limited, featuring only automatically
generated output for machine runs, but otherwise works similarly.

You can run a machine as follows:

~~~ haskell
-- | Duplicate all "ones" on the band
d 0 (Just '1') = ('1', Right 0)
d 0 Nothing    = ('!', Left 1)
d 1 (Just '1') = ('!', Right 2)
d 1 Nothing    = ('!', Right 4)
d 2 (Just '1') = ('1', Right 2)
d 2 (Just '!') = ('1', Left 3)
d 2 Nothing    = ('1', Left 3)
d 3 (Just '1') = ('1', Left 3)
d 3 (Just '!') = ('1', Left 1)

main = mapM print $$ run d [4] (0, ([], Just '1', "11"))
~~~

In the last line, the `[4]` means that state 4 is the only accepting state.
The initial state of the band is "" (empty) to the left, a '1' under the
tape head and "11" to the right of the tape head.
The output of the program is below:^[Note that the tape to the left of the
tape head looks reversed, as it is "seen" from the tape head.]

~~~
(0,("",Just '1',"11"))
(0,("1",Just '1',"1"))
(0,("11",Just '1',""))
(0,("111",Nothing,""))
(1,("11",Just '1',"!"))
(2,("!11",Just '!',""))
(3,("11",Just '!',"1"))
(1,("1",Just '1',"11"))
(2,("!1",Just '1',"1"))
(2,("1!1",Just '1',""))
(2,("11!1",Nothing,""))
(3,("1!1",Just '1',"1"))
(3,("!1",Just '1',"11"))
(3,("1",Just '!',"111"))
(1,("",Just '1',"1111"))
(2,("!",Just '1',"111"))
(2,("1!",Just '1',"11"))
(2,("11!",Just '1',"1"))
(2,("111!",Just '1',""))
(2,("1111!",Nothing,""))
(3,("111!",Just '1',"1"))
(3,("11!",Just '1',"11"))
(3,("1!",Just '1',"111"))
(3,("!",Just '1',"1111"))
(3,("",Just '!',"11111"))
(1,("",Nothing,"111111"))
