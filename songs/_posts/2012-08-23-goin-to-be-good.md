title: Goin' To Be Good
---

Hi there! On a trip to Vorarlberg (most western country of Austria, featuring a people nobody but themselves and the Swiss understand ^^), I had the idea for this song. The recording features Lukas Hartl on the guitar and on the background vocals --- enjoy!

Lyrics
------

	Goin' to a distant country
	goin' to see you
	and I'm a little nervous
	'cause I don't know what we'll do.
	Will we have good times together
	will you see me through?
	But I have a good feeling
	'cause I'm goin' to see you.

	Refrain:
	And I have this feeling, oooh
	it will be goin' as it should
	I have this feeling
	that it's goin' to be good.

	When you meet me at the train
	what shall we then talk?
	Perhaps you will offer me
	to go out for a walk?
	Will you take my hand while walking
	or will you look away?
	I don't know, but I hope
	that it will be good today.

	<Refrain>

	<Solo>
	When I have to leave tomorrow
	gettin' on the train
	I'm not sad
	'cause I know we'll meet again.

	And I have this feeling, oooh
	it has been goin' as it should
	I have this feeling
	that it has been really good.
